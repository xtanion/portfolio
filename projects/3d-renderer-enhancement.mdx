# 3D Renderer Enhancement

Enhanced the FURY scientific visualization library with modern 3D rendering capabilities including glTF 2.0 support, keyframe animations, and advanced interpolation techniques.

## Overview

Contributed to the open-source FURY project by implementing cutting-edge 3D rendering features for scientific and medical visualization applications.

## Key Features

- **glTF 2.0 Support**: Full implementation of the modern 3D asset format
- **Keyframe Animations**: Smooth animation system with timeline control
- **Spline Interpolation**: Advanced interpolation techniques for smooth motion
- **Scientific Visualization**: Optimized for medical and scientific data rendering

## Technical Implementation

Built using:
- **Python** for the core rendering pipeline
- **OpenGL** for low-level graphics rendering
- **glTF** for 3D asset management
- **Computer Graphics** techniques for optimization

## Open Source Contribution

Contributed to the Python Software Foundation's FURY project, with code merged into the main repository and used by researchers and developers worldwide.
