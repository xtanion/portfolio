# Distributed Task Processing

A highly scalable distributed task processing system built on Celery, capable of handling over 10,000 concurrent operations with robust fault tolerance and monitoring.

## Overview

Designed and implemented a production-grade distributed task queue system to handle high-volume background processing for web applications at scale.

## Key Features

- **10k+ Concurrent Operations**: Efficiently processes thousands of tasks simultaneously
- **Redis Clustering**: High-availability message broker with failover support
- **PostgreSQL Optimization**: Optimized database queries and connection pooling
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

## Technical Architecture

The system leverages:
- **Celery** for distributed task execution
- **Redis** as the message broker and result backend
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage with advanced optimization
- **Python** for worker implementation

## Performance

Achieved 99.9% uptime with average task processing time under 100ms and automatic retry mechanisms for failed tasks.
